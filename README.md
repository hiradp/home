# üè° Home
Home is where this repo is cloned & installed.

## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration files for my home directory. It is
intended to be used by me. However, you are free to use it as well or take
inspiration from it.

## Installation

The vision is to have this be fully automated. However,
for now, the installation of tools are manual. Installation of the configuration
files is as simple as cloning the repository and running the `install.sh` script.
